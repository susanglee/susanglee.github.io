**The Impact of COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Payments on Local Small Businesses**

  Abstract: This research investigates the economic impact of COVID-19 and direct stimulus payments, focusing on offline businesses in South Korea. In South Korea, each district paid its citizens or households different amounts of stimulus to boost the local economy from the pandemic, before the universal stimulus payments by the central government came in. Utilizing this heterogeneity in policy, we apply the differences-in-differences approach to two provinces, Gyeonggi and Incheon. We also investigate the impact of stimulus payments by the central government. We constructed district-level panel data from public and private sources, including weekly offline card sales transactions and COVID-19 confirmed cases from January to August 2020. We first show that the size of the pandemic, measured by the number of local or nationwide COVID-19 patients, placed a negative impact on offline sales in general. After controlling for the size of the local and nationwide pandemic, we find that the provision of stimulus payments from the local governments in Gyeonggi helped revive offline sales, while temporarily, compared to those in Incheon, where no local stimulus money was distributed. Furthermore, the impact of the central government on local offline business was sizable. However, we couldn’t find any substantial differences between rich and poor districts in sales change, upon the universal payments from the central government. Lastly, we also comment on heterogeneous impacts by industry including online businesses as well.

  Abstract: How can we teach machines to quantify economic activities from satellite images? In this paper, we share the research progress in answering the question. We document what we have learned so far – characteristics of geospatial data including satellite images and recent developments in computer vision and image processing. We then identify some challenges in adopting the machine learning techniques to address the question. We present two of our proposed deep learning models that address some of the challenges: the first model predicts economic indicators from a satellite image by resolving the mismatch in data representation, and the second model learns to score the level of economic development of a satellite image even without ground-truth data. We also talk about our future research agenda to improve the models and to apply them for economic research and policymaking in practice.

**Too powerless to speak up: Effects of social rejection on sense of power and employee voice**

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Abstract: Enabling and amplifying the voice of employees creates opportunities for organizational improvement. Prior research has shown that employees' sense of power has impact on their voice behavior. As such, when would employees feel too powerless to speak up in the workplace? The current study investigates the indirect effect of social rejection (via sense of power) on employee voice. We use conservation of resources theory to explain this relationship. Experimental data from two studies demonstrate that participants reminded of social rejection (vs. acceptance) exhibit a lower sense of power. Specifically, we observe that social rejection diminishes a person's sense of power, and that social acceptance does not enhance this sense. That is, social rejection has an indirect effect on employee voice through sense of power. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings with regard to social rejection, sense of power, and workplace voice behavior.

**Why Does Forgiving Boost Creativity? The Role of Cognitive Persistence**
*Su Sang Lee, Eun Jin Jung, Junha Kim, Sujin Lee*

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Abstract: This study elucidates the specific cognitive mechanism by which the act of forgiving enhances creativity. We use the dual pathway to creativity model to examine whether the act of forgiving increases creativity via cognitive persistence (generating detailed ideas within a small number of categories), but not via cognitive flexibility (generating multiple categories and switching ideas between categories). Two experiments conducted within separate Korean and US samples provided convergent evidence that cognitive persistence, not flexibility, mediates the forgiving-creativity link. Our study suggests that how cognitive resources are deployed serves as a driving mechanism for the creativity-related benefits of forgiving.
